# tpm - Project Management as Code
**tpm** tackles several challenges faced in modern software development:
  * Development and project management tools are often housed in separate systems like GitHub and Jira. This separation can result in **wasted** development resources due to the need for **continuous synchronization**. **tpm** expands **GitOps** to include project management, offering a **single source of truth** for all software development lifecycle activities.
  * Keeping project status **up-to-date** can be challenging and often requires **setting up and maintaining** a BI subsystem within the project management system. **tpm** **automatically** generates all reports and statistics **directly** from the repository, up to the **latest commit**
  * Managing **multiple** software projects, especially when resources are shared, is inherently challenging and often causes numerous issues with **timelines and estimates**. **tpm** offers a comprehensive overview, or "**eagle's view**", of any number of projects.

## Approach (GitOps + PM)
**tpm:**
- Employs a Git repository to store all SDLC artifacts.
- Automatically generates essential project management artifacts.
- Estimates new tasks based on completed ones.
- Expands the SDLC to allow AI agents to participate in the software development process.

## Demo project
* Run next docker command to see tpm in action using test project
  ```
  docker run -it -p 5445:5445 --rm vladyslavkurmaz/sh.tln.pm:0.22.0
  ```
* Open next link in browser
  ```
  http://localhost:5445
  ```

## Quick start
| **Note** : `Windows has its own **tpm** utility. To prevent conflicts, the Talan CLI is available as **tpmw* on Windows` |
| ----------------------------------|

* Install `Nodejs 20.x` or higher (https://nodejs.org)
* Install tpm
  ```
  npm i -g tln-pm@0.22.0
  ```
* Navigate to your project's Git repository root folder and set up the initial configuration
  ```
  tpm config --project --team --timeline --tasks
  ```
* Update **.tpm.conf** with your project's details, including team structure, timeline, and tasks. Ensure that the emails used for **tpm** configuration match toyr dev team emails.

  ```yml
  project:
    id: myproject
    name: My Project
    description: My project description
  team:
    alice.c:
      email: alice.c@gmail.com
      name: Alice Clarke
  timeline:
    25.9.0:
      deadline: '2025-09-28T18:00:00.000Z'
  tasks: |
    [>:002:25.9.0] Integrate auth library @alice.c
      [!] Add /iam/auth endpoint #16h
      [>] Configure auth callbacks #4h
    [-:001:25.9.0] Create project structure #16h @alice.c
  ```
* Now you can start managing your project using cli and git

  | Command | Description |
  | ------------- | -------------
  | tpm ls --backlog | Display tasks are in backlog for current git user (you) |
  | tpm ls -g alice.c | Display tasks in development were assigned to the Alice |
  | tpm ls -g alice.c --backlog | List of tasks are in Alice backlog |
* The following command will provide a high-level "eagle view" of your project in the browser **http://localhost:5445**
  ```
  tpm serve
  ```

## Task statuses & attributes
  * Task can be described in multiple forms depends on requirements
    | Example  | Description |
    | ------------- | ------------- |
    | [-:010:25.2.0] Task with release version | This format should be used for top level task with specific deadline |
    | [-:001] Task with Id | Top level task but without delivery version |
    | [-] Simple task with description only | This format is useful for subtasks |
  
  * First symbol in square brackets describes status of the task
    | Symbol | Meaning         | CLI option |
    | ---    | ---             | ---        |
    | \-     | todo            | --todo     |
    | >      | in development  | --dev      |
    | !      | blocked         | --blocked  |
    | \+     | done            | --done     |

## Mentionings, Tags, Links
A lightweight DSL may be included in the task title to enrich it with additional context and details
  * @alex.m - assigns the task to Alex
  * #backend - adds the backend tag to the task
  * #16h - sets the time estimate for the task to 16 hours
```
